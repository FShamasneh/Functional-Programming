import Prelude hiding (flip, elem)

-- Ex: count 'a' s returns the number of 'a' characters in the string
-- s. Use the library function sum.

-- Ex: how many times the maximal element appears in a list? Use the
-- library function maximum

-- Ex:

flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c

-- filter

-- all the off numbers from [1..100]

-- Ex: return the numbers from the input list which are divisible by 3
-- or 5

powersOf2' :: Int -> [Int]
powersOf2' n = [ x^2 | x <- [0..(n-1)]]

-- Ex: double of the First 10 Square Numbers

doubleOfSquares :: [Int]
doubleOfSquares = undefined

-- Ex: list the divisors of 60.

divisorsOf60 :: [Int]
divisorsOf60 = undefined

-- Ex: test whether a number is a prime (meaning it only has two
-- divisors: 1 and itself).

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime = undefined

-- Ex: which is the least power of 2 which is bigger than 10^20
-- (100000000000000000000)? Hint: use the head function.

leastPowerOf2 :: Integer
leastPowerOf2 = undefined

-- Ex: generate the following infinite string: "* ** *** ****
-- *****..." Hint: use replicate to generate sequences of starts and
-- unwords to make them into a string.

stars :: String
stars = undefined

-- Ex: generate a list that contains all (hour, minute) pairs in a day.

hoursMinutes :: [(Int, Int)]
hoursMinutes = undefined

-- Ex: generate the following infinite list: [1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,...].

-- 0,1,0,-1,0,1,2,1,0,-1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0,-1,...

-- Ex: define the map function using list comprehension

-- Hint: first generate the [1, -3, 5, -7, 9, -11, ... ] infinite list.
-- Then take the reciprocals and add the numbers.
