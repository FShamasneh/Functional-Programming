-- Ex: count 'a' s returns the number of 'a' characters in the string
-- s. Use the library function sum.

count :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int
count x ys = sum (map (\y -> if x == y then 1 else 0) ys)

-- Ex: how many times the maximal element appears in a list? Use the
-- library function maximum

falseTrues = map even [1..1000]

-- Ex:

flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
flip f y x = f x y

-- filter

-- all the off numbers from [1..100]

odds' :: [Int]
odds' = filter odd [1..100]

-- Ex: use filter

count' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int

-- or 5

nums35 :: [Int] -> [Int]

powersOf2 :: Int -> [Int]

-- Ex: list the divisors of 60.

divisorsOf60 :: [Int]
divisorsOf60 = [x | x <- [1..60], 60 `mod` x == 0]

-- Ex: test whether a number is a prime (meaning it only has two
-- divisors: 1 and itself).

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime x = length [ y | y <- [1..x], x `mod` y == 0] == 2

-- Ex: which is the least power of 2 which is bigger than 10^20
-- (100000000000000000000)? Hint: use the head function.

leastPowerOf2 :: Integer
leastPowerOf2 = head [ 2^x | x <- [1..], 2^x > 10^20]

-- Ex: generate the following infinite string: "* ** *** ****
-- *****..." Hint: use replicate to generate sequences of starts and
-- unwords to make them into a string.

stars :: String
stars = unwords [ replicate i '*' | i <- [1..]]

-- Ex: generate a list that contains all (hour, minute) pairs in a day.

hoursMinutes :: [(Int, Int)]
hoursMinutes = [(h, m) | h <- [0..23], m <- [0..59]]

-- Ex: generate the following infinite list: [1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,...].

counting :: [Int]
counting = concat [ [1..n] | n <- [1..] ]

-- Advanced exercises for clever people

-- Ex: generate the following list:
-- 0,1,0,-1,0,1,2,1,0,-1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,2,1,0,-1,...

-- Ex: define the map function using list comprehension

map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

-- Ex: generate a list that contains all (month, day) pairs in a
-- 365-day year.

-- Ex: generate the infinite list all pairs of natural numbers,
-- e.g. [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,2),(1,1),(2,0), ...].

-- Ex: calculate the value of pi using Leibniz' method:
-- pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...
-- It is enough to take the first 1000 components.
-- Hint: first generate the [1, -3, 5, -7, 9, -11, ... ] infinite list.
-- Then take the reciprocals and add the numbers.
